# Toxic Comments Classification Project

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model for the online store "Wikishop" that can identify toxic comments. This tool will help the moderation team by flagging toxic comments for review. Your task is to build a classification model that distinguishes between positive and negative (toxic) comments. The target performance metric is an F1 score of at least 0.75.

## Data Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- **text** — the text of the comment
- **toxic** — the target label indicating the toxicity of the comment (1 for toxic, 0 for non-toxic)
